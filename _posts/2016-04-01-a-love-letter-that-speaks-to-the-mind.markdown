##Between the Ecstasy and Agony

A friend of mine recently confessed that the pseudo-platonic relationship she trapped herself into was going nowhere. She felt devastated over the possibility of losing something that was never there to begin with. And though, the signs were there from the beginning she kept feeding the illusion until it bite her back ripping her heart in half. Because I love her dearly, and because I've been in the similar situations number of times, I write this _Love Letter_ to remind her, myself, and others that after the rain comes the sun, and after the sun comes the storm. 

In that respect our inner life is a fertile soil for cultivating many goods. Personally, I'd take that over a dry desert any day.

The Generation Y, as many like to refer to the contemporary 20 and 30 year olds, is specific in many aspects; however, one sticks out as it seems to be the ongoing issue and struggle across the globe. Relationships are the source of human's highest highs and lowest lows. They can evoke ecstasy or agony, and often both at the same time. Then what are so many of us doing wrong, since we seem to be unable to form and maintain one? I cannot say with certainty but I have made observations over the time. Drawing a conclusion is up to the each individual. You and I might not agree on everything but here's a Goliath everyone seems to stumble upon.

##Can We Be Afraid of Losing Something We Don't Have?

As in any sphere of human activity, fear plays a major role in forming relationships. I find it fascinating that so many of us are terrified of losing someone we might feel emotional about that we don't even allow the relationship to happen in the first place. We crave emotions but we don't allow them to develop. At least not to fully develop; as if we a nourishing a baby inside of a uterus for months, even years, but we won't let it to come out, to be born, and to become a real, living thing.

Honesty is replaced with persuasion, care with interest, loyalty with objectivity, and love with selfishness. As much as it might be practical to keep our actions, thoughts, and emotions in check, the overwhelming self-control won't replace the feelings we yearn for.

Those that have been hurt in the past struggle to move forward; once they finally do, instead of overcoming their fears, and welcoming new people and new relationships with open hearts they tend to take those fears out on a new person. He or she is your new partner who hasn't cheated, lied, betrayed, disappointed or left you yet. I say yet because accusing someone of a crime undone is not only unjust, but it also leads to the dreaded behavior. However, it's a risk one has to be ready to take on if they ever intend to engage in a meaningful relationship.

_Being ready_ is becoming a main theme when it comes to the conversations about relationships, usually in the context of: _Not being ready_ for something or someone. Talking about it won't change anything in the decaying stage of our relationships unless we take steps towards becoming ready. Saying, "I am not ready," and leaving things at it is like saying, "I am an alcoholic," and not doing anything about it while hoping to end an addiction.

##The Struggle is Real

People are becoming open minded and close hearted. Let it not become the main characteristic of Generation Y's relationships. 

We might be witnessing an epochal shift in the way people build micro and macro societies. Relationships might be evolving from ones formed with love and care, or at least an illusion of it, to the ones appointed with fair trade, bargain, and exchange of goods. In order for the former to become possible, before finding a cure for cancer scientist should find a cure for emotions. 

Until then we are ought to make the best out of relationships that we are given.
