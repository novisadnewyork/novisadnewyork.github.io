## Love Hurts

A friend of mine recently conffessed that the pseudo-plathonic relationship she trapped herself in was going no where. She felt devasted over the posibility of losing something that was never there to beging with. And though, the signs were there from the beginning she kept feeding the ilusion untill it bite her back hard ripping her heart in half. Because I love her dearly, and because I've been in the similar situations number of times, I write this _Love Conffesion_ to remind her, myself, and all others that after the rain comes the sun, and that after the sun come clouds and a storm. In that respect our inner life could be reflecting a furtile soil for cultivating many goods. Personaly, I'd take that over dry deserts any day.

The Generation Y, as many like to reffere to the contemporary 20 and 30 year olds, is specific in many asspects; however, one sticks out as it seams to be the ongoing theme and strugle accross the globe. Relationships are the source of human's highest highs and lowest lows. They can cause extacy or agony, and often both at the same time. So what are so many of us doing wrong since we seam to be unable to form and maintain one? I cannot say with certancy but I have made some interesting observations. I live it up to you to draw a conclusion.

## Can We Be Afraid of Losing Something We Don't Have?

As in any sphere of human activity fear plays a major role in forming relationships. I find it fascinatng that so many of us are too terrrified of losing someone we might feel emotional about that we don't even allow the relationship to happen in the first place. Honesty is replaced with precausion, care with interest, loyalty with objectivity, and love with selfishness. As much as it might be practical to keep our actions, thoughts and emotions in check the oveerwhelming contronl wont replace the feeling we yearn for.
Those who have been hurt in the past struggle to move on; and once they finally do, insted of putting fears aside and welcoming new people and new relationships with an oppen heart they they tend to take out it out on the new person. He or she is you new partner who hasn't cheated, lied, betrayled, disapointed or left you yet. I say yet because accusiong someone of a crime undone is not only unjust, but it could also lead to a dreaded behaviour.

Peopele are becoming open minded and close hearted might be the main characteristic of modern day relationships. We might be vitnessing the epohal shift in the way people form micro and macro comunities, moving from relationships based in love and care, or at least an illusion of it, to a fair trade burgin and excange of goods. Of course in order for that to become posible before sinding cure for cancer scientist have to find cure for emotions.
