## Mind vs Heart

A friend of mine recently conffessed that the pseudo-plathonic relationship she trapped herself in was going no where. She felt devasted over the posibility of losing something that was never there to beging with. And though, the signs were there from the beginning she kept feeding the ilusion untill it bite her back hard ripping her heart in half. Because I love her dearly, and because I've been in the similar situations number of times, I write this _Love Letter_ to remind her, myself, and all others that _after the rain comes the sun_.
The Generation Y, as many like to reffere to the contemporary 20 and 30 year olds, is specific in many asspects; however, one sticks out as it seams to be the ongoing theme and strugle accross the globe. Relationships are the source of human's highest highs and lowest lows. They can cause extacy or agony, and often both at the same time. So what are so many of us doing wrong since we seam to be unable to form and maintain one? I cannot say with certancy but I have made some interesting observations. I live it up to you to draw a conclusion.

## Fear
As in any sphere of human activity fear plays a major role in forming relationships. I find it fascinatng that so many of us are so terrrified of losing someone they might feel emotional about that we don't even allow the relationship to happen in the first place. Honesty is replaced with precausion, care with interest, loyalty with objectivity, and love with selfishness. Those who have been hurt in the past struggle to move on, and once they finally do insted of putting fears aside and welcoming new people and relationship with an oppen heart 

Peopele are becoming open minded and close hearted might be the main characteristic of modern day relationships. We might be vitnessing the epohal shift in the way people form micro and macro comunities, moving from relationships based in love and care, or at least an illusion of it, to a fair trade burgin and excange of goods. Of course in order for that to become posible before sinding cure for cancer scientist have to find cure for emotions.
